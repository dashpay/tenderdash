# State ID

## State ID definition

`StateID` is a unique identifier of the most recent application state validated in consensus at the time of block generation.

## State ID rationale

In Dash Platform documents are returned to clients that request them. The validity of these documents is verified by checking that the root hash of the document tree is signed by the one of the platform quorums which are used as Tenderdash validator sets.

Before the introduction of the `StateID` verification that the last app hash was properly signed would have required passing all the components that are used in the blockID generation to light clients. StateID should be considered a subset of the BlockID which allows for small proofs for Dash Platform clients.

## State ID generation

Let's define the following:

* `State(height=N)`  - State where `LastBlockHeight == N`
* `StateID(height=N)` - State ID generated for `State(height=N)`
* `Block(height=N)` - Block at `height == N`
* `Vote(height=B, stateID=S)` - Vote for `Block(height=B)`, with state ID generated from `State(height=S)`
* `Commit(height=B, stateID=S)` - Commit for `Block(height=B)`, with state ID generated from `State(height=S)`

StateID logic works as follows:

1. System is in `State(height=N-1)`
2. New block `Block(height=N)` is proposed.
3. Validators vote for `Block(height=N)` by creating `Vote(height=N, stateID=N-1)`; note that this vote contains state ID for `State(height=N-1)`, as this is the most recent confirmed state
4. Block is accepted and `Commit(height=N, stateID=N-1)` is generated
5. System state is updated to `State(height=N)`
6. New block `Block(height=N+1)` is proposed that contains last commit  `Commit(height=N, stateID=N-1)`

        Block -->|"3. Vote for block"| Vote["Vote (height=N, stateID=N-1)"]
        Vote -->|"4. Block accepted"| Commit["Commit (height=N, stateID=N-1)"]
        Commit -->|"5. Update system state"| NewState["State (height=N)"]
        NewState -->|"6. New block proposal"| NewBlock["Block (height=N+1, stateID=N)<br/>
            with LastCommit=Commit (height=N, stateID=N-1)"]
    end
```

As a result:

* verification of a vote for the block at height `N` requires information about the AppHash returned from ABCI App in response to a commit for the height `N-1`,
* block at height `N` contains the commit referring to state ID at height `N-2`.

## Commit StateID verification

Commit for a block at height `N` is a part of block `N+1`. This commit requires AppHash generated after the commit of
block `N-2`. To verify StateID, blocks `N` and `N+1` are needed.

To verify StateID from a commit at height `N` :

1. Fetch block `Block(Height=N+1)`  which contains the commit to verify
2. Fetch block `Block(Height=N)` which contains AppHash needed for the verification
3. Ensure `Block(Height=N+1).LastCommit.StateID.Height == N-1`
4. Ensure `Block(Height=N+1).LastCommit.StateID.LastAppHash == Block(Height=N).Header.AppHash`
5. Ensure `Block(Height=N+1).LastCommit.StateSignature` is correct
