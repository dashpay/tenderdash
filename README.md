Tenderdash is a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) middleware that takes a state transition machine -
written in any programming language - and securely replicates it on many machines.

## Background

Tenderdash started as a fork of the [Tendermint Core](https://www.github.com/tendermint/tendermint)
project and has been used in public environments such as the Cosmos Network. Although based on
Tendermint, Tenderdash differs from Tendermint through its use of Dash's [long-living masternode
quorums (LLMQs)](https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/dip-0006.md) to support threshold
signatures, quorum-based voting, and dynamic validator set rotation. These enhancements to support
rapid transaction finality and maintain strong security guarantees make Tenderdash ideal for Dash
Platformâ€™s needs.

For Tendermint protocol details, refer to the [Tendermint Specification](./spec/README.md). For a
detailed analysis of the consensus protocol, including safety and liveness proofs, read the
Tendermint paper, "[The latest gossip on BFT consensus](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04938)".
Tendermint documentation can be found on [docs.tendermint.com](https://docs.tendermint.com/).

## Releases

Please do not depend on master as your production branch. Use the binaries provided on the [GitHub
releases page](https://github.com/dashpay/tenderdash/releases) instead.

## Install

See the [install instructions](./docs/introduction/install.md). Make sure to meet the minimum
requirements if installing from source.

### Minimum requirements

| Requirement | Notes            |
|-------------|------------------|
| Go version  | Go1.23.2 or higher |

## Versioning

### Semantic Versioning

Tenderdash uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) to determine when and how the version
changes.

The Tenderdash API includes all publicly exposed types, functions, and methods in non-internal Go
packages as well as the types and methods accessible via the RPC interface. Breaking changes to
these public APIs will be documented in the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md).

### Supported Versions

Because we are a small core team, we only ship patch updates, including security updates, to the
most recent minor release and the second-most recent minor release. Consequently, we strongly
recommend keeping Tenderdash up-to-date.
